						<h2>Introduction</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="flex">
						<h3>Art Criticism - An Interface of Art for the Public</h3>
						<p>The visual arts have experienced a period of dynamic growth and professionalization over the past two decades in the United States. In the wake of these changes, a timely question to ask is whether the popular news media provide sufficient exposure for artists, arts institutions and the ideas that govern their work. To find an answer to this question, in early 2002, the National Arts Journalism Program invited visual art critics at general-interest news publications to fill out an online questionnaire about their backgrounds, work habits, tastes and opinions on issues of concern to the visual arts in America today.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="flex">
						<h3>Data Selection</h3>
						<p>The dataset is procured from media art theorist and journalist - András Szántó’s project - “The visual art critic - A Survey of Art Critics At General-Interest news publications in America”. The 230 visual art critics identified by the current study represent the preponderance of critics who shape the public’s awareness and opinion of art today. The responses of 169 (73 percent) of them  inform the conclusions of this report. Together, they write for a combined audience of approximately 60 million readers.  Funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts and based at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, in association with Columbia’s School of the Arts, the National Arts Journalism Program administers fellowships for mid-career and senior journalists in the fields of arts and culture. The NAJP also serves as a forum for discussion of challenging and timely issues at the crossroads of arts and culture, journalism and public policy, through publications, panels and conferences that bring together professionals from these fields.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="flex">
						<h3>Analysis Framework</h3>
						<p>András Szántó’s original survey investigated a myriad of issues concerning contemporary American art criticism. In our project, we specifically explored the patterns of art critics’ ratings of selected artists, to illustrate the dynamic, variegated and vigorous contemporary American art criticism scene. We used different metrics of the rating matrix, from individual art critic’s average ratings of all artists to a statistic we devised explicitly for this evaluation - agreeability score, convoluted with other attributes of the visual arts critics, namely, their professionalism, economic status, gender, relationship with the arts beside criticism and so on, to delineate the pattern of visual arts critique.</p>

						<h2>Previously..., Introduction of the "Agreeability Score"</h2>
					</header>

					<div class="flex">
						<p>This final term project continues our previous effort on the analysis of critics' ratings of artists. (You can get access to our midterm project <a href="agree.html">here</a>.) Last time, we introduced the concept of "agreeability score", which denotes one critic's ratings of artists tend to be agreeable to his/her peers. As the establishment of an influential art critic is essentially one of becoming a key opinion leader, we deem this agreeability score central to an art critic's prestige and power of critique. </p>

						<h2>The Big Question: What Makes an Art Critic More "Agreeable" ?</h2>
					</header>

					<p class="flex">In this final project, we position agreeability score at the center of our investigation, explore and test its relationship to other metrics and information around an art critic. As the original survey answered by 170+ art critics include sixty plus modules and more than two hundred questions, we first handpicked some of the most intuitive ones that we thought would reveal interesting patterns. We allow the user to select one question at a time from the curated list, then the dashboard would reveal dynamically the average agreeability score of the group of art critics who choose a particular answer as well as the number of critics who have chosen that answer. After gaining some intuition through some initial exploration of the dataset, we wanted to study what are the most significant features that have contributed to a critic's agreeability score. To do this, we went through a feature engineering process where we created three additional features based on both the data from the original dataset and information we queried from Wikipedia. Lastly, we fed the new dataset into weka and used SVM to reveal the feature weights and reflected on the implications.</p>

                    <p class="flex">We first want to give the users a sense of what the dataset is all about. It is a survey for art critics where they were asked a bunch of questions about their demographic, career, background, education, opinions toward certain issues, and so on. In this explorative section, we expect the user to develop a sense of how these info of an art critic could be meaningfully related to their agreeability score, which to some degree, represents an art critic's prestige and authority. We handpicked representative questions from which hypotheses are more likely to be generated. For example, an art critic's education level could possibly affect his or her expertise in art criticism, therefore directly affect their agreeability score. Their experience as an art critic would also reasonably contribute to how their standards are seen as benchmarks. Their approach toward writing about art criticism could also condition their critique of artists. On the other hand, we consider their opinions about certain issues within the art community and beyond as a product of these generative motives and professional groundings combined with their personalities, thus should be treated at the same level as their perceptions about artists, which is the crux of this investigation.</p>

                    <p class="flex">We want machine learning to tell us what are the most significant features that contribute to an art critic's agreeability score. Besides those features that come with the original data set, we felt strongly about introducing some higher level and deep features to the game. We interpreted the power of critique as an agency to penetrate the mist of gossip and squabble and obtain a piercing view of artists and their view. One immediately available metric to represent the squabble of the mass is simply how popular an artist is among all people, within the pan art community or not. Relative to this, there should be another metric of acknowledgement about artists among those experts deeply involved within the criticism tribe. The generation of these two rankings are documented in detail in later chapters (Feature Engineering). Here we want to point out that, despite the trend line showing a correlation between the rankings of popularity among art critics and the mass, we also admit that these are two distinctive system of evaluation. And we believe that how an art critic's ratings of artists are influenced by these two general value system would tell a different story about their agreeability score.</p>

                        It's tempting to use quantitative method such as machine learning to learn about what is considered a more subjective and nebulous field such as art criticism, especially at a scale that is not available to traditional methods and paradigm in the humanities. However, we also see that sometimes it is hard to make sense of what the algorithm is trying to tell us, and it is also impossible to elaborate after the analysis from the data at hand. We do see ML can point to some interesting areas for further qualitative investigation. It is important to combine both quantitative and qualitative approaches in order to have a robust understanding of the complex and beautiful art world.
